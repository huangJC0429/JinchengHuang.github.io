Hi~ I am a second-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), advised by Xiaofeng Zhu, and currently a visiting PhD student at SUTD, advised by Lei Feng. I worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). I have been awarded the National Scholarship for Graduate Students and the Tencent Scholarship.
