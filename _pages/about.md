Hi~ I am a second-year PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), advised by [Xiaofeng Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-bk1CrcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and currently a visiting PhD student at SUTD, advised by [Lei Feng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KomQOFkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA).


**My close collaborators**: [Liang Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GuKZfakAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jie Xu](https://submissionsin.github.io/JIEXU.github.io/), [Yujie Mo](https://yujiemo.github.io/), [Mengmeng Zhan](), [Lu Zeng](), [Zongqian Wu](https://zongqianwu.github.io/), [Yonghua Zhu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CVP8vGEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Rongyao Hu](https://yjsjy.uestc.edu.cn/gmis/jcsjgl/dsfc/dsgrjj/21524?yxsh=09), [Jiangzhang Gan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FMVDBN0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).


I am currently working on trustworthy graph learning, with a focus on calibration. In the future, I plan to explore trustworthy outputs of LLMs and MLLMs. ***I am also looking for collaborators***. If you're interested, feel free to contact me via email.
